<h3>1. What is Cascading?</h3>
</summary>
"Cascading" in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) refers to the process by which the browser determines which CSS rules apply to an element. The "cascade" is a set of rules that define how to handle conflicts between multiple CSS rules that could apply to the same element. The term "cascading" describes how styles cascade down from multiple sources to determine the final style for an element.

**Here are the key concepts related to the cascading nature of CSS:**

1. **Inheritance**: Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to child elements. For example, `text-related` properties like `color` and `font-family` are typically inherited, while layout-related properties like `margin` and `padding` are not.

1. **Specificity**: Specificity is a ranking system that determines which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules could apply to the same element. It's calculated based on the types of selectors used in the rule. For example, an ID selector (`#example`) is more specific than a class selector (`.example`), and a class selector is more specific than a tag selector (`div`).

1. **Source Order:** When two rules have the same specificity, the rule that appears last in the CSS file takes precedence. This is known as source order. The browser reads the CSS from top to bottom, applying styles as it goes, with later rules potentially overriding earlier ones.

1. **Importance**: The `!important` declaration can be added to a CSS rule to give it higher precedence over other conflicting rules. Even if other rules are more specific, an `!important` rule will take precedence.

1. **Origin**: CSS rules can come from different sources, including the browser's default styles, external style sheets, internal style sheets (within the HTML file), and inline styles (directly on the HTML element). The order of precedence, from lowest to highest, is usually:

   - Browser default styles
   - External and internal (embedded) styles
   - Inline styles
   - `!important` declarations, which override all the above

Together, these rules help the browser decide which styles to apply when there are multiple possibilities, ensuring a consistent and predictable rendering of the web page.

<h3>2. What is box-model in css</h3>
</summary>
The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design and development, describing how elements are structured and displayed on a web page. The box model comprises several components that define the space an element occupies and its content, padding, border, and margin. Here's a breakdown of each component:

1.  **Content Box:**

    - This is the area where the content (text, images, etc.) is displayed.
    - The `width` and `height` of the content box can be set using the `width` and `height` properties.

1.  **Padding:**

    - `Padding` is the space between the content box and the border.

    - It creates space inside the element, around the content. - `Padding` can be set using the padding property, and you can set - padding for each side individually (e.g., `padding-top,` `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`).

1.  **Border:**

    - The border surrounds the padding and content.
    - It can have various styles (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) and widths.
    - Borders can be set using the `border` property, and you can set borders for each side individually (e.g., `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom,` `border-left`).

1.  **Margin:**

    - The margin is the space outside the border, creating distance between the element and other elements.
    - It can be set using the `margin` property, and you can set `margins` for each side individually (e.g., `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`,` margin-left`).

**Example**

Here's an example to illustrate how the box model components work together:

```js
div {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid black;
  margin: 30px;
}

```

In this example:

- The content box has a width of 200px and a height of 100px.
- The padding adds 20px of space inside the element, around the content.
- The border adds 10px of space around the padding.
- The margin adds 30px of space outside the border.

**Box Model Diagram**

The total width and height of the element, including padding, border, and margin, can be calculated as follows:

- Total width = content width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
- Total height = content height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin

For the example above:

- Total width = 200px (content) + 20px (left padding) + 20px (right padding) + 10px (left border) + 10px (right border) + 30px (left margin) + 30px (right margin) = 320px
- Total height = 100px (content) + 20px (top padding) + 20px (bottom padding) + 10px (top border) + 10px (bottom border) + 30px (top margin) + 30px (bottom margin) = 220px

Understanding the box model is crucial for accurately designing and laying out web pages, ensuring that elements are sized and spaced as intended.

<summary>
<h3>3. What is difference between box-sizing `border-box` and `content-box`</h3>
</summary>

The `box-sizing` property in CSS controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated. There are two main values for the box-sizing property: `content-box` and `border-box`. Hereâ€™s the difference between them:

**`box-sizing: content-box`**

- Default Behavior: This is the default value. When you set the `width` and `height` of an element, it only includes the content area. Padding, border, and margin are added outside of this specified width and height.
- Calculation:
  - Total width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border
  - Total height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border

**Example**:

```js
div {
  box-sizing: content-box;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid black;
}

```

- Content width: 200px
- Total width: 200px (content) + 20px (left padding) + 20px (right padding) + 10px (left border) + 10px (right border) = 260px
- Content height: 100px
- Total height: 100px (content) + 20px (top padding) + 20px (bottom padding) + 10px (top border) + 10px (bottom border) = 160px

**`box-sizing: border-box`**

- Alternative Behavior: When you set the `width` and `height` of an element, it includes the content, padding, and border. The margin is still added outside this total.
- Calculation:
  - Total width = width (including content, padding, and border)
  - Total height = height (including content, padding, and border)

**Example**:

```js
div {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid black;
}

```

- Content width: 200px - 20px (left padding) - 20px (right padding) - 10px (left border) - 10px (right border) = 140px
- Total width: 200px (including content, padding, and border)
- Content height: 100px - 20px (top padding) - 20px (bottom padding) - 10px (top border) - 10px (bottom border) = 40px
- Total height: 100px (including content, padding, and border)

**When to Use**

- **`content-box`**: Use when you need precise control over the content area, and don't mind manually adding the padding and border sizes.
- **`border-box`**: Use when you want a more predictable element sizing, where the total size remains as specified regardless of padding and border sizes.

Setting `box-sizing: border-box` globally is a common practice to avoid issues with sizing calculations

```js
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

```

This ensures that all elements on the page use the `border-box `model, simplifying the layout calculations.

<h3>4. What is Specificity  </h3>
</summary>

CSS specificity is a mechanism that determines which CSS rule will be applied to an element when multiple rules could apply. It is a measure of how specific a selector is, with more specific selectors having higher precedence. Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used in the rule.

**Specificity Calculation**

Specificity is usually represented by a four-part value (a, b, c, d), where:

- a: Inline styles (not common in practice, but have the highest specificity)
- b: ID selectors (#example)
- c: Class selectors (.example), attribute selectors ([type="text"]), and pseudo-classes (:hover)
- d: Type selectors (div, h1) and pseudo-elements (::before, ::after)

The specificity value is calculated by counting the number of each type of selector in the compound selector and combining these counts into a four-part value. Higher values have higher specificity.

**Example Calculation**

1. **Inline Style**: `style="color: red;`" has a specificity of (1, 0, 0, 0).
1. **ID Selector**: `#example` has a specificity of (0, 1, 0, 0).
1. **Class Selector**: `.example` has a specificity of (0, 0, 1, 0).
1. **Type Selector**: `div` has a specificity of (0, 0, 0, 1).

**Combined Example**

For a more complex selector like div#example .highlight:hover:

- `div` has a specificity of (0, 0, 0, 1).
- `#example` has a specificity of (0, 1, 0, 0).
- `.highlight` has a specificity of (0, 0, 1, 0).
- `:hover` has a specificity of (0, 0, 1, 0).
  The combined specificity would be (0, 1, 2, 1).

**Specificity Rules**

1. **Inline styles** have the highest specificity and will override any styles in the CSS.
1. **ID selectors** are more specific than class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes.
1. **Class selectors**, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes are more specific than type selectors and pseudo-elements.
1. **Type selectors** and pseudo-elements have the lowest specificity.
1. **Universal selectors** `(*),` combinators (`+, >, ~, `), and negation pseudo-class (:not()) do not affect specificity.

**Example**

Consider the following CSS:

```js
/* Example 1 */
p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Example 2 */
#example {
  color: green;
}

/* Example 3 */
.highlight {
  color: red;
}

/* Example 4 */
div .highlight {
  color: purple;
}

```

For an element `<p id="example" class="highlight">Hello</p>`, the color will be determined by the most specific selector:

- `p` has a specificity of (0, 0, 0, 1).
- `#example` has a specificity of (0, 1, 0, 0).
- `.highlight` has a specificity of (0, 0, 1, 0).
- `div .highlight` has a specificity of (0, 0, 1, 1).
  Since `#example` has the highest specificity, the color will be green.

**Important Declarations**

The `!important` declaration can override normal specificity rules. Any rule with `!important` will take precedence over others, regardless of specificity.

```js
p {
  color: blue !important;
}

#example {
  color: green;
}

```

In this case, even though `#example` has a higher specificity, the paragraph will be blue because of the `!important` declaration.

**Summary**

Understanding specificity helps you write more predictable CSS, troubleshoot styling issues, and ensure the correct styles are applied to elements on your web page.

<h3>5. What is display property of img</h3>
</summary>

In CSS, the display property specifies how an element is displayed on the page. For an <img> element, the display property can be used to control its layout behavior. By default, an image has the display property set to inline, but you can change it to other values to achieve different layouts.

**Common `display` Property Values for `<img>`**

1. `display`: `inline` (default):

   - The image is treated as an inline element, meaning it flows along with text and other inline elements.
   - Example:

   ```js
   img {
   display: inline;
   }

   ```

1. `display`: `block`:

   - The image is treated as a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line.
   - Example

   ```js
   img {
   display: block;
   }

   ```

   - Use case: When you want the image to behave like a block element, taking up the entire width of its container.

1. `display`: `inline-block:`

   - The image is treated as an inline element but can have block-level properties such as width and height.
   - Example

   ```js
   img {
   display: inline-block;
   }

   ```

   - Use case: When you need the image to be inline but want to control its dimensions or add padding/margin.

1. `display`: `none`:

   - The image is not displayed at all. It is removed from the document flow.
   - Example

   ```js
   img {
   display: none;
   }

   ```

   - Use case: When you want to hide the image without removing it from the HTML.

**Examples of `display` Property with Images**

`display`: `inline` (Default)

```js
<p>This is some text <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image"> with an inline image.</p>

```

The image will flow along with the text.

`display`: `block`

```js
<p>This is some text.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" style="display: block;">
<p>This is more text after the block image.</p>

```

The image will start on a new line and take up the full width of its container.

`display`:` inline-block`

```js
<p>This is some text <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 100px;"> with an inline-block image.</p>

```

The image will be inline but you can control its dimensions.

`display`: `none`

```js
<p>This is some text.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" style="display: none;">
<p>This is more text where the image would have been.</p>

```

The image will not be displayed.

**Other Values**

In addition to the common values, the display property can take many other values (e.g., `flex, grid, table,` etc.), but these are less commonly used directly on images. Instead, they are more often applied to the containers or parents of images to control the overall layout.

Understanding how the display property affects an image helps you create more flexible and responsive web designs.

<h3>6. What is Position Property</h3>
</summary>

The position property in CSS specifies how an element is positioned in the document. It can take several values, each affecting the element's layout in different ways. Here are the main values of the position property and their effects:

**position: static**

- Default value: This is the default positioning for all elements.
- Behavior: Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow. top, right, bottom, and left properties have no effect.
- Use case: Default positioning; no need for special layout requirements.

```js
div {
  position: static;
}

```

**`position: relative`**

- Behavior: The element is positioned according to the normal document flow, but it can be offset relative to its normal position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
- Use case: Adjusting the position of an element without affecting the layout of other elements.

```js
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px; /* Moves the element 10px down from its normal position */
  left: 20px; /* Moves the element 20px to the right from its normal position */
}

```

**`position: absolute`**

- Behavior: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, position: absolute, position: fixed, or position: sticky). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
- Use case: Removing an element from the document flow and positioning it exactly where needed.

```js
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px; /* Positions the element 50px from the top of the nearest positioned ancestor */
  left: 100px; /* Positions the element 100px from the left of the nearest positioned ancestor */
}

```

**`position: fixed`**

- Behavior: The element is positioned relative to the viewport and does not move when the page is scrolled.
- Use case: Creating fixed headers, footers, or other elements that stay in place during scrolling.

```js
div {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0; /* Positions the element at the top of the viewport */
  left: 0; /* Positions the element at the left of the viewport */
  width: 100%; /* Makes the element full width */
}

```

**`position`: `sticky`**

- Behavior: The element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified point (defined by top, right, bottom, or left), after which it is treated as fixed within its containing block.
- Use case: Creating elements that stick to the viewport edge when scrolling past them.

```js
div {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0; /* Sticks the element to the top of its containing block when scrolling past it */
}

```

**Example to Demonstrate All Positions**

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Position Property Example</title>
<style>
  .static {
    position: static;
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
  .relative {
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;
    left: 20px;
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
  .absolute-container {
    position: relative;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: lightcoral;
  }
  .absolute {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    left: 50px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
  .fixed {
    position: fixed;
    top: 10px;
    right: 10px;
    background-color: lightpink;
  }
  .sticky {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    background-color: lightyellow;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="static">Static Position</div>
<div class="relative">Relative Position</div>
<div class="absolute-container">
  Absolute Container
  <div class="absolute">Absolute Position</div>
</div>
<div class="fixed">Fixed Position</div>
<div class="sticky">Sticky Position</div>
<div style="height: 2000px;">Scroll down to see sticky and fixed elements in action.</div>

</body>
</html>

```

**Summary**

- `static`: Default positioning, follows normal document flow.
- `relative`: Offsets element relative to its normal position.
- `absolute`: Positions element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- `fixed`: Positions element relative to the viewport, remains fixed during scrolling.
- `sticky`: Behaves like `relative` until a specified point, then acts like `fixed`.

Understanding the `position` property is crucial for creating complex layouts and controlling the positioning of elements on a web page.

<h3>7. How css file connect</h3>
</summary>

In an HTML document, there is no strict limit on the number of CSS files you can link or include. You can connect multiple CSS files to a single HTML page using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section. Each `<link>` element specifies a different CSS file, allowing you to modularize and organize your stylesheets effectively.

<h3>8. Which position property default</h3>
</summary>

In CSS, the `position` property determines how an element is positioned in a document. The default value of the `position` property is `static`.

</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3>9. What is diff bet absolute and relative position</h3>
</summary>

The absolute and relative values of the CSS position property define different positioning behaviors for elements within the document flow. Understanding the differences between these two values is key to mastering layout control in CSS.

**`position: relative`**

1. Positioning Context:

   - An element with `position: relative` is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. It retains its place in the normal document flow, so space is still allocated for the element in its original position.

1. Offset Properties:

   - The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties can be used to move the element away from its normal position. The movement is relative to where the element would have been positioned in the normal flow.
   - The offsets don't affect the positioning of other elements around it; they do not cause other elements to reposition.

1. Use Cases:

   - Useful for slight adjustments to an element's position without removing it from the flow of the document.
   - Can serve as a containing block for absolutely positioned child elements.

**Example**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Relative Position Example</title>
    <style>
      .relative-box {
        position: relative;
        top: 20px;
        left: 30px;
        background-color: lightgreen;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        border: 2px solid green;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="relative-box">Relative Box</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the box is moved 20px down and 30px to the right from its normal position, but the space it originally occupied remains in the document flow.

**`position: absolute`**

1. Positioning Context:

   - An element with position: absolute is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it does not occupy space in the layout. Other elements are positioned as if the absolutely positioned element does not exist.
   - It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position set to something other than static). If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block, usually the <html> element or the browser window.

1. Offset Properties:

   - The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to set the position of the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.

1. Use Cases:

   - Ideal for creating components that need to be precisely placed or layered on top of other content, such as tooltips, modals, or overlays.
   - Useful in designing complex layouts where elements need to be positioned independently of the surrounding content.

**Example**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Absolute Position Example</title>
    <style>
      .container {
        position: relative;
        width: 300px;
        height: 200px;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
      .absolute-box {
        position: absolute;
        top: 50px;
        left: 50px;
        background-color: lightcoral;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        border: 2px solid red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="absolute-box">Absolute Box</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `.absolute-box` is positioned 50px from the top and 50px from the left of its nearest positioned ancestor, .`container`. The `.absolute-box` is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it doesn't affect the layout of other elements.

**Key Differences**

- Flow Impact:

  - `relative`: The element remains in the document flow, and space is allocated for it.
  - `absolute`: The element is removed from the document flow, and no space is allocated for it.

- Positioning Context:

  - `relative`: Positioned relative to its original location in the document flow.
  - `absolute`: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block if no ancestor is positioned.

- Usage:

      - `relative`: Small adjustments or positioning context for absolute children.
      - `absolute`: Precise, independent positioning, often used for floating elements.
