<h3>1. Difference between Div and Span</h3>
</summary>

`<div>` and `<span>` are two fundamental HTML elements used for grouping and styling content, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics.

**`<div>` Element**

- **Type**: Block-level element
- **Usage**: Used for grouping larger sections of content or layout purposes.
- **Behavior**: Occupies the full width available (by default), creating a block of content.
- **Common Uses**: Structuring sections of a web page, creating layouts, wrapping multiple elements.
  **Example:**

```js
<div>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
```

**`<span>` Element**

- **Type**: Inline-level element
- **Usage**: Used for styling or grouping smaller pieces of text or inline content.
- **Behavior**: Does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
- **Common Uses**: Styling parts of text, wrapping small pieces of content without affecting the flow of the document.
  Example:

```js
<p>
  This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a paragraph.
</p>
```

**Visual Representation**

`<div>` Example:

```js
<div style="border: 1px solid black;">
  <h1>Header</h1>
  <p>Paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
<div style="border: 1px solid black;">
  Another div.
</div>

```

This will render as two separate blocks, each starting on a new line and occupying the full width.

`<span> `Example:

```js
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> word in a paragraph.</p>
<p>Another paragraph with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold</span> word.</p>

```

This will render the words "`red`" and "`bold`" with their respective styles, without affecting the flow of the text.

**When to Use**

Use `<div>` when you need to create distinct sections or blocks of content on your web page.
Use `<span>` when you need to apply styles or classes to specific parts of inline content without disrupting the flow of text.
Understanding the differences between `<div> `and `<span> `helps in structuring HTML documents appropriately and applying styles effectively.

<h3>2. In HTML why use DOCTYPE</h3>
</summary>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML specifies the document type and version of HTML being used. It is an important part of the HTML document because it helps the browser understand how to render the content.

</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3>3. Why do you use Semantic tags</h3>
</summary>

Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaningful structure to the content of a webpage. These tags not only describe how the content looks but also define its meaning and role within the document. This enhances the understanding of the content for both browsers and developers, and it provides several key benefits:

1. **Improved Accessibility**

Semantic tags make it easier for assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to interpret and present the content to users with disabilities. For example, using `<nav>` to define navigation sections or`<header>`for header content helps screen readers navigate the page more effectively.

2. **Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**

Search engines use the structure and tags within an HTML document to understand the content and its relevance. Semantic tags help search engines better index and rank pages by clearly defining the content structure and importance of various parts. For example, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<aside> `help indicate the primary content and side information.

3. **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability**

Semantic tags provide meaningful names that convey the purpose of the content, making the code easier to read and understand. This is especially useful in collaborative projects or when returning to a project after some time. For example, `<footer>` clearly indicates the footer section of a page, as opposed to a non-semantic tag like `<div>`.

4. **Enhanced Styling and Consistency**

By using semantic tags, you can apply consistent styling across different sections of your site. For example, if all articles are enclosed within `<article>` tags, you can style them uniformly using CSS, enhancing both the visual and functional consistency of the website.

5. **Future-Proofing**

Using semantic tags helps ensure that your web content remains relevant and accessible as web technologies evolve. Since these tags are standardized and widely supported, they are less likely to become obsolete compared to non-semantic tags or custom structures.

Examples of Semantic Tags

`<header>`: Represents a header section, usually containing introductory content or navigational links.

`<nav>`: Defines a set of navigation links.

`<article>`: Specifies independent, self-contained content that could be distributed independently (like a blog post or news article).

`<section>`: Represents a standalone section, typically with a heading.

`<aside>`: Contains content that is tangentially related to the main content (like sidebars or call-out boxes).

`<footer>`: Represents a footer section, usually containing information about the author, copyright information, or links to related documents.

`<main>`: Specifies the main content of a document, excluding header, footer, and navigation sections.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Example Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Website Title</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <article>
        <h2>Article Title</h2>
        <p>This is the main content of the article.</p>
      </article>
      <aside>
        <h3>Related Links</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#link1">Link 1</a></li>
          <li><a href="#link2">Link 2</a></li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 Example Website</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

<h3>4. What are attribute</h3>
</summary>

Attributes in HTML are additional information provided within an HTML tag that helps define the properties and behaviors of an element. Attributes are always specified in the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs. They provide details about an element that are not considered content, such as its identity, appearance, or functionality.

**Key Points about Attributes**

1.  Structure:

    - An attribute consists of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=). The value is enclosed in double quotes (") or single quotes ('), though double quotes are more commonly used.
    - Example:` <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`
    - Here, src and alt are attribute names, and "image.jpg" and "Description" are their respective values.

1.  Common Attributes:

        - id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element. Example: `<div id="header">`.
        - class: Defines one or more class names for an element, which can be used to style the element with CSS. Example: `<p class="intro">`.
        - style: Contains inline CSS styles for the element.    - Example: `<h1 style="color: blue;">`.
        - src: Specifies the source file for media elements like images, videos, and audio. Example: `<img src="image.jpg">`.
        - href: Provides the URL for a link in an <a> tag. Example: `<a href="https://example.com">`Visit Example</a>.
        - alt: Provides alternative text for images, used by screen readers and when the image cannot be displayed. Example:` <img src="image.jpg" alt="A description of the image">.`
        - title: Provides additional information about an element, often shown as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the    - element. Example: `<p title="Tooltip text">Hover over me!</p>.`

    data- attributes\*: Used to store custom data private to the page or application. They are prefixed with data- and can hold any information. Example: `<div data-user-id="12345">.`

1.  Boolean Attributes:

    - Some attributes do not require a value and are considered "boolean attributes." These attributes are either present or absent, and their presence typically represents a true value.
    - Example: `<input type="checkbox" checked>` (The checked attribute is a boolean attribute indicating that the checkbox should be initially checked).

1.  Global Attributes:

    - These attributes can be used on any HTML element. Examples include class, id, style, title, and lang.

1.  Specificity and Overriding:

    - Attributes can override other settings. For instance, an inline style attribute (using the style attribute) will override styles defined in external or internal CSS.

Example

Here's an example demonstrating the use of various attributes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Attribute Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header id="main-header" class="header">
      <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#home" title="Go to Home">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#about" title="Learn more about us">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="#contact" title="Contact us">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <section>
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We are a company that values excellence...</p>
        <img src="company-logo.png" alt="Company Logo" width="200" />
      </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:

- The `id` attribute is used for the header (`id="main-header"`), making it uniquely identifiable.
- The `class` attribute is used for styling purposes (`class="header"`).
- The `src` attribute specifies the source of the image (`src="company-logo.png"`).
- The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image (`alt="Company Logo"`).
- The `href` and `title` attributes in the `<a> `tags specify the destination URL and additional information shown as tooltips, respectively.

<h3>5. What is iframe</h3>
</summary>

An `<iframe>` (short for inline frame) is an HTML element that allows you to embed another HTML document within the current document. Essentially, it creates a "window" within your webpage through which you can display content from another webpage or a different part of your own site.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3>6. What is HTML</h3>
</summary>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It structures web pages by using a series of elements and tags to define content and layout.

**Importance of HTML**
- **Web Structure:** Provides the fundamental structure of web pages.
- **SEO**: Helps search engines understand the content and structure of your web pages.
- **Accessibility**: Improves accessibility for users with disabilities.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures web pages work across different browsers and devices.

<h3>7. WHat is diff bet HTML and HTML5</h3>
</summary>

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and HTML5 refer to different versions of the same markup language used for creating web pages. HTML5 is the latest version and includes numerous updates and new features that improve upon the capabilities of the older HTML standards. Here are the key differences between HTML and HTML5:

**Key Differences Between HTML and HTML5**

1. New Semantic Elements

HTML5 introduces several new semantic elements that provide more meaning to the structure of web documents:

  - `<header>`: Represents the header section of a document or section.
  - `<footer>`: Represents the footer section of a document or section.
  - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
  - `<section>`: Defines a section in a document.
  - `<nav>`: Represents a section of navigation links.
  - `<aside>`: Represents content aside from the main content.
2. Multimedia Support

HTML5 has native support for audio and video elements without requiring third-party plugins (like Flash):

- `<audio>`: Embeds sound content.

- `<video>`: Embeds video content.
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```
3. Graphics and Effects

HTML5 supports graphics and animations through elements and APIs like:

- `<canvas>`: Allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and images.
- `SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)`: Can be used for vector graphics directly in HTML.
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```
4. New Form Elements and Attributes

HTML5 introduces new form input types and attributes, enhancing form validation and user input:

- New input types: email, date, number, range, search, tel, url, etc.
- New attributes: required, placeholder, pattern, autocomplete, etc.
```html
<input type="email" required placeholder="Enter your email">
<input type="date">
```
5. APIs and New Features

HTML5 includes various APIs and features for building rich web applications:

- Geolocation API: Allows web applications to access the user's geographical location.
- Web Storage API: Provides local and session storage for storing data on the client-side.
- Web Workers: Enables background processing in web applications.
- Offline Web Applications: Allows web applications to function without an internet connection through the use of application cache and service workers.
6. Deprecated Elements and Attributes

HTML5 removes certain elements and attributes that are considered obsolete:

- Deprecated elements: `<font>, <center>, <big>, <basefont>`, etc.
- Deprecated attributes:` align, bgcolor, border (on certain elements),` etc.
7. Doctype Declaration

HTML5 simplifies the doctype declaration:

- HTML: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">`
- HTML5: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
8. Character Encoding

HTML5 specifies UTF-8 as the default character encoding:

- HTML: `<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">`
- HTML5: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
Summary

HTML5 enhances the capabilities of HTML by introducing new semantic elements, native multimedia support, graphics and effects, advanced form controls, new APIs, and simplified syntax. These improvements make HTML5 more powerful, flexible, and suitable for developing modern web applications.

<h3>9. What is diff bet Block-level and inline elements</h3>
</summary>

Block-level and inline elements are fundamental concepts in HTML and CSS, and understanding the difference between them is crucial for web development. Here’s an overview of the key differences between block-level and inline elements:

**Block-Level Elements**

1. Display Property:

- Block-level elements have a display property of block.
- They take up the full width available, which means they start on a new line and stretch out to the left and right as far as they can.
2. Content Flow:

- Block-level elements begin on a new line, and any content following a block-level element will also start on a new line.
3. Examples:

- Common block-level elements include:
```html

<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <form>, <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <blockquote>
```
4. Box Model:

- Block-level elements respect the full box model properties including margin, border, padding, and width.
- You can set the width and height of a block-level element.
5. Nested Elements:

- Block-level elements can contain both block-level and inline elements.

**Inline Elements**

1. Display Property:

- Inline elements have a display property of inline.
- They only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.
2. Content Flow:

- Inline elements do not force a new line to start after the element. Content will continue to flow on the same line unless it is broken by a block-level element or a line break (`<br>`).
3. Examples:

- Common inline elements include:
```html
Copy code
<span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <abbr>, <cite>, <code>, <kbd>, <mark>, <small>, <sub>, <sup>
```
4. Box Model:

- Inline elements respect margin and padding, but only horizontally. Vertical margin and padding do not affect the flow of surrounding elements.
- You cannot set the width and height of an inline element; they are determined by the content.
5. Nested Elements:

- Inline elements can contain other inline elements but should not contain block-level elements directly.

**Visual Representation**
Block-Level Elements:
```html
<div style="background-color: lightblue; margin: 10px;">
  This is a block-level element.
</div>
<p style="background-color: lightgreen; margin: 10px;">
  This is another block-level element.
</p>
```
- Both elements will start on a new line and occupy the full width available.

Inline Elements:

```html
<span style="background-color: lightcoral; margin: 10px;">
  This is an inline element.
</span>
<a href="#" style="background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow; margin: 10px;">
  This is another inline element.
</a>
```
- Both elements will display on the same line if space allows and only take up as much width as their content requires.

**Summary**

- Block-Level Elements:

    - Start on a new line.
    - Occupy the full available width.
    - Can contain both block-level and inline elements.
    - Examples: `<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <form>`, etc.
- Inline Elements:

- Do not start on a new line.
- Occupy only as much width as their content.
- Can contain only inline elements.
- Examples: `<span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>,` etc.

Understanding these differences helps in designing and structuring web pages effectively, ensuring that content is displayed as intended.

<h3>10 What is the anchar tag a</h3>
</summary>

he `<a> `(anchor) tag is used in HTML to create hyperlinks, which are one of the most essential elements of web browsing. Here’s a detailed explanation of its use, attributes
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3>11. What is HMTL entities</h3>
</summary>

HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or that might be difficult to include directly in the HTML code. They are particularly useful for representing characters that are reserved in HTML or that might not be easily typed on a keyboard.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<h3>12. What is Meta tags</h3>
</summary>

The `<meta>` tag in HTML is used to provide metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is information about the document that is not directly visible to users but can be used by browsers, search engines, and other web services. The `<meta>` tag is placed within the `<head>` section of an HTML document.

**Key Attributes of the `<meta>` Tag**
1. charset

- Specifies the character encoding for the document.
- Ensures that the text is displayed correctly in different languages and character sets.
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
- UTF-8 is a common encoding that supports many characters and symbols.
2. name

- Defines the type of metadata being provided.
- Commonly used with values such as "description", "keywords", "author", "viewport", etc.
```html
<meta name="description" content="This is a description of the web page.">
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
<meta name="author" content="John Doe">
```
3. content

- Provides the value associated with the name attribute.
- The value typically describes or defines the information related to the specified name.
```html
<meta name="description" content="This is a description of the web page.">
```
4. http-equiv

- Provides HTTP headers information.
- Common values include "Content-Type", "X-UA-Compatible", and "Refresh".
```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
```
- This example ensures that Internet Explorer uses the latest rendering engine.
5. viewport

- Controls the layout on mobile browsers and defines how the page should be scaled and sized.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
- This example sets the width of the viewport to the device's width and the initial zoom level to 1.
6. robots

- Provides instructions to search engine robots about indexing and following links on the page.
```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```
- This example tells search engines not to index the page and not to follow any links on it.

***Example of Using `<meta>` Tags***

Here's an example of how various <meta> tags might be used in a complete HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="This is a detailed description of the web page for SEO purposes.">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web development">
  <meta name="author" content="Jane Doe">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <title>Example Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is an example of an HTML document with various meta tags.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
**Summary**
The `<meta>` tag is a versatile HTML element used to provide metadata about a web document. It is placed in the `<head>` section and can include various attributes to define character encoding, document description, keywords, author information, viewport settings, and more. Proper use of meta tags helps with SEO, ensures correct display and functionality across different devices and browsers, and provides important information to web services and search engines.
